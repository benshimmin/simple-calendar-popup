# simple-calendar-popup

A very basic calendar popup which I initially created to match a few specific
requirements from a client, but in the end decided was generic enough that it
might be useful to a few people.

If the 2000+ lines of jQuery UI's DatePicker makes you feel queasy, this may be
for you.
